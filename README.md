# STM32 LCD LIBRARY
This library is for stm32 but you can make a port for another microcontroller easy
this libraries is still not yet finished but it works.
the microcontroller using in the examples are STM32G030C8T6.


## How to use the library

### 1. Define gpio as output
First you have to define the necesary outputs of microcontroller.
7 output for 4 bit mode  and 11 output for 8 bit mode.
